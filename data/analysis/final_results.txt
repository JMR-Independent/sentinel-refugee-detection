FINAL RESULTS — HONEST ASSESSMENT
======================================================================

SPECTRAL MODEL (NDBI LogReg, LOCO):
  Mean AUC = 0.612
  
TEXTURE MODEL (structural features, LOCO):
  Mean AUC = 0.566

ORACLE (best pathway per country):
  Mean AUC = 0.648

ADAPTIVE (τ from training): 
  Mean AUC = 0.578
  FAILS because: n=7 countries is too few to learn τ.
  South Sudan is the ONLY country with gap < 0.
  When excluded, no training signal exists for that regime.

SCIENTIFIC CONCLUSIONS:

1. NDBI spectral gap explains 83% of spectral detection variance (r=0.91)
   This is a SENSOR/PHYSICS limitation, not algorithmic.

2. Structural features (GLCM, gradient, FFT) recover partial signal
   in South Sudan where spectral fails: AUC 0.356 → 0.542.

3. The structural signal DIRECTION INVERTS between biomes:
   - Arid: camps are more textured (built structures on bare ground)
   - Humid: camps are smoother (cleared ground in vegetation)
   → No universal structural signature either.

4. Automatic gating (τ) fails with n=7 because South Sudan is unique.
   This means: environment characterization MUST be done a priori.
   You cannot learn which detector to use from other countries alone.

5. Oracle shows potential: mean AUC = 0.648 if you know which pathway
   to use. But this requires environmental knowledge, not more ML.

PAPER IMPLICATION:
   The contribution is the CHARACTERIZATION of when detection is possible,
   not the detector itself. The environment determines the signal type,
   the signal type determines the detector, and this chain cannot be
   shortcut by bigger models or more data at 10m resolution.
