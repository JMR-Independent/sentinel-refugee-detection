  Per-country AUC stability (L2CO):
    chad             mean=0.642 ± 0.058  (n=6)
    ethiopia         mean=0.679 ± 0.037  (n=6)
    south_sudan      mean=0.235 ± 0.005  (n=6)
    syria            mean=0.527 ± 0.023  (n=6)
    turkey           mean=0.750 ± 0.055  (n=6)
    uganda           mean=0.654 ± 0.012  (n=6)
    yemen            mean=0.660 ± 0.019  (n=6)

--- Conclusion ---
The correlation between NDBI spectral gap and LOCO AUC is robust:
  - Country-level: r=+0.912 (R²=0.832)
  - Per-camp: r=+0.597
  - Bootstrap CI excludes zero: [+0.558, +0.995]
  - Permutation p=0.0046
  - L2CO: r=+0.872 (stable across training set compositions)

Implication: 83% of cross-country detection variance is explained
by NDBI spectral contrast alone. This is a sensor/physics limitation,
not an algorithm limitation.
