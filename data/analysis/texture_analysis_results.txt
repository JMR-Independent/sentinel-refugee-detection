TEXTURE ANALYSIS RESULTS — COMPREHENSIVE REPORT
================================================================================

1. HYPOTHESIS
   Camp structures create detectable spatial organization even when spectrally
   invisible. At 10m, this manifests as:
   - Higher GLCM homogeneity (regular spacing)
   - Lower gradient magnitude (cleared, leveled ground in humid biomes)
   - Lower edge fraction (fewer natural edges in cleared areas)
   - Lower directional entropy (aligned structures)

2. SOUTH SUDAN DISCRIMINATION (n=50 camps, 104 negatives)
   Feature                  Cohen's d    p-value   Direction
   GLCM dissimilarity        -0.70       0.0002    camp < neg ***
   GLCM homogeneity          +0.68       0.0003    camp > neg ***
   Gradient magnitude (mean) -0.66       0.0003    camp < neg ***
   Edge fraction             -0.59       0.0017    camp < neg **
   GLCM contrast             -0.59       0.0002    camp < neg ***
   GLCM energy               +0.50       0.0051    camp > neg **
   GLCM correlation          +0.48       0.0016    camp > neg **
   
   Interpretation: Camps in South Sudan are SMOOTHER and more HOMOGENEOUS
   than natural surroundings. The "cleared ground" effect is detectable
   even though the material (mud) is spectrally identical.

   Mean spectral:   0.612
   Mean texture:    0.566
   Oracle (best):   0.648

4. DUAL-PATHWAY RESULTS (threshold = 0, sign-based)
   Mean AUC = 0.605 (vs 0.612 spectral-only)
   South Sudan: 0.356 → 0.542 (+0.186)
   But Syria: 0.663 → 0.426 (-0.237)

5. ENSEMBLE (steepness=100, signed gap)
   Mean AUC = 0.619 (best ensemble, vs 0.612 spectral)
   South Sudan: 0.356 → 0.542 (w_spectral=0.00)
   Yemen: 0.706 → 0.735 (improvement!)

6. KEY FINDING
   Texture features DO contain discriminative signal in humid biomes
   where spectral fails. However:
   
   a) Texture features are NOT universally robust either.
      The direction flips: camps are "more textured" in arid environments
      but "smoother" in humid environments.
   
   b) A global texture model performs WORSE than a global spectral model
      (0.566 vs 0.612) because the feature directions are inconsistent.
   
   c) The BEST strategy is environment-adaptive:
      - Arid (NDBI gap > 0): use spectral features
      - Humid (NDBI gap ≤ 0): use texture features
      - Ensemble mean AUC = 0.619

7. IMPLICATION FOR THE PAPER
   This STRENGTHENS the observability argument:
   - Detection is environment-dependent regardless of feature type
   - Spectral: limited by material contrast
   - Texture: limited by organization contrast direction flip
   - Both confirm: no universal camp signature exists at 10m
   - Environment must be accounted for in any detection pipeline
   
   The texture analysis adds a second dimension to the paper:
   it shows that even when spectral fails, structural features can
   partially recover detection, but the detectability limit shifts
   rather than disappears.
